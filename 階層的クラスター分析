# English lyrics
lyrics = """
Since when has time stopped?
In the waves of sound, left and right
When I nodded and thought this was fine
They pointed and said something was strange
When I think of the place I can't go back to
When I think of the people I can't meet
Kicked the amp and it cried out loudly
In a small world of 15 watts
I kicked the amp
I kicked the amp
It cried out loudly, it cried out loudly
Distortion hit the wall
